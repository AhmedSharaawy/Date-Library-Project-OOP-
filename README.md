# clsDate & clsPeriod – Date and Period Management in C++

## Overview

This project contains two main classes: **clsDate** and **clsPeriod**, designed to handle date operations and period comparisons in C++.

The goal of the project is to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts by implementing common date calculations and utilities manually.

A small part of the project uses a previously built custom string library (**clsString**), specifically the `SplitString` function, to parse date values from text.

## Main Components

### clsDate

A class that represents a date and provides multiple utilities, including:

- Date validation
- Leap year detection
- Day, month, and year calculations
- Date comparisons
- Adding and subtracting:
  - Days
  - Weeks
  - Months
  - Years
- Business days and vacation calculations
- Calendar printing

---

### clsPeriod

A class that represents a time period between two dates.

**Main features:**

- Store start and end dates
- Check if two periods overlap
- Print period details

## Project Purpose

- Practice OOP concepts in C++
- Work with multiple related classes
- Implement date and period logic manually
- Reuse functionality from a custom string library
